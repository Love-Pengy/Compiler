    For help: 
        With The Command built, run the command:  make run ARGS="-help"

    For running: 
        Use command make run ARGS="<arguments>"  where <arguments> is replaced with the normal arguments that you would have after the executable if running it direct
        or
        Run executable "tc" in the bin folder and use arguments as usual 

    For cleaning: 
        Use command "make clean"

    For testing:    
        To test use the same method as running except replace the word "run" with test 
            test will run gdb as normal with the arguments supplied
            if you uncomment the line starting with ADDARGS in the Makefile it will run it with the -fsanitize=address flag
