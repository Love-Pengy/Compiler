+~~ what is returned out of the lexer needs to be a struct with a LEXEME and a STRING (this will represent what it actually is)~~
+~~ lets call this struct a token~~
+ ~~implement getLineNum~~
+ ~~implement getPos~~
+ ~~make a print function for the structs~~
+ Write up a file for trees so I can just call it and test it seperately
