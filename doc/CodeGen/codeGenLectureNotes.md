+ Everything will be an int
+ functions/functions calls are extra credit
    + these have no partial credit
+ all semantic errors are fatal
    + not a specific spec for how they should look but you should know where it failed
+ identifiers can not be redefined 
+ division by 0 is undefined
+ will be split between back and and front end
    + back end is target code
    + front end if source code
+ scope changes after the LPARAN
```C
    //EXAMPLE
                 start of new scope because parameters are local, function definitions are not
                 v
    int whatever(int one, int two){
        //function blah
    }
}
```
